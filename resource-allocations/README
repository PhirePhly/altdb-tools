Extended and Normalized Resource Statistics from All RIRs

This collection of daily snapshots are taken from the five RIRs
(AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, RIPE) and combined into one file to
aid others with analysis relating to resource allocations on the Internet.

The format presented is slightly different from that defined by IANA:
  1. There is no header or summary lines. All lines are resource records
  2. ASN entries have been uncompressed (normalized) from if sequential
     records are identical.

This second feature is meant to make it particularly easier for basic
checks like grepping for an ASN to see its current status. If it has been
allocated from IANA to one of the RIRs, it will now be in this database,
where before it was possible that it was represented by a lower ASN with
a count of more than one.

For a useful breakdown on the meaning of each field, see ARIN's annoucement
of the new format:
